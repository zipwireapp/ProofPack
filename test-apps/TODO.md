## üö® Critical Issues

### Phase 2.5 Blocking Progress
- **Current Phase 2 is incomplete** - only placeholder implementation
- **No real cryptographic testing** - just structure validation
- **Phase 3+ blocked** until real JWS implementation is complete
- **Missing core purpose** - ensuring signatures work across platforms

**Last Updated**: January 2024
**Next Priority**: Phase 2.5 - Real JWS Implementation (CRITICAL)
**Blocking**: All subsequent phases until real cryptographic operations are implemented
