# Supply Chain Use Cases: Balancing Transparency and Confidentiality

This document explores real-world supply chain scenarios where ProofPack's selective disclosure capabilities solve critical business problems by enabling verification without compromising security or privacy.

## The Supply Chain Transparency Challenge

Modern supply chains face a fundamental tension: stakeholders need to verify compliance, sustainability, and authenticity while protecting sensitive operational details that could expose workers, locations, or competitive advantages to risk.

Traditional approaches often force organizations to choose between:
- **Complete transparency** - revealing everything but exposing vulnerabilities
- **Complete opacity** - protecting security but losing trust and market access

ProofPack enables a third path: **selective disclosure** that proves specific claims while keeping everything else confidential.

## How ProofPack Works in Supply Chains

The ProofPack workflow for supply chain transparency follows these steps:

1. **Full Data Collection**: An app collects complete supply chain data including sensitive details like exact locations, worker information, and operational methods.

2. **Merkle Tree Creation**: The app uses ProofPack's JavaScript library to create a Merkle tree containing all the collected data, with each piece of information properly salted and hashed.

3. **On-Chain Attestation**: The root hash of the complete Merkle tree is attested on-chain by a trusted authority, creating an immutable record that the full dataset exists and is authentic.

4. **Selective Disclosure**: From the complete Merkle tree, the app can create selective disclosure proofs that reveal only specific information needed for different stakeholders:
   - **Supermarket buyers** might see certification status and general region
   - **Government auditors** might see detailed compliance data and processing methods
   - **Consumers** might see sustainability claims and basic provenance
   - **Competitors** might see only the minimum required for market access

This approach ensures that all data is verifiably authentic (through the on-chain attestation) while allowing precise control over what information is revealed to each stakeholder.

## Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining

### The Problem
Gold, diamonds, and rare earth minerals from small operations need certification that they're conflict-free and use safe labor practices. However, revealing exact mine locations could expose workers to:
- Theft and extortion from armed groups
- Dangerous working conditions from criminal elements
- Targeting by corrupt officials or competitors

### The ProofPack Solution
A mining certification app collects complete operational data and creates a full Merkle tree attested on-chain. From this complete dataset, selective disclosure proofs can be created for different stakeholders:

- **For certification bodies**: Reveals conflict-free status, labor safety records, and environmental compliance data
- **For buyers**: Shows certification status and general region without exact mine coordinates
- **For government auditors**: Provides detailed compliance data, worker safety records, and environmental impact assessments
- **For consumers**: Displays basic sustainability claims and conflict-free certification status



## Wild-Caught Seafood

### The Problem
Fishermen need to prove their catch comes from sustainable, legal fishing grounds and uses responsible methods. However, disclosing precise fishing locations could lead to:
- Overfishing by competitors in vulnerable waters
- Piracy and theft of equipment
- Targeting by illegal fishing operations

### The ProofPack Solution
A fishing compliance app collects complete operational data and creates a full Merkle tree attested on-chain. From this complete dataset, selective disclosure proofs can be created for different stakeholders:

- **For marine authorities**: Reveals detailed fishing methods, vessel information, and catch data
- **For buyers**: Shows sustainable fishing zone compliance and legal permits without exact coordinates
- **For government inspectors**: Provides comprehensive compliance data, vessel routes, and catch verification
- **For consumers**: Displays sustainability claims and responsible fishing practices



## Forest Products

### The Problem
Timber, mushrooms, and medicinal plants from indigenous communities require sustainable harvesting verification. However, exact forest locations must remain secret to prevent:
- Illegal harvesting and poaching
- Land grabbing by commercial interests
- Disruption of traditional practices
- Environmental damage from unauthorized access

### The ProofPack Solution
A forestry management app collects complete operational data and creates a full Merkle tree attested on-chain. From this complete dataset, selective disclosure proofs can be created for different stakeholders:

- **For conservation authorities**: Reveals detailed harvesting methods, species impact assessments, and habitat protection measures
- **For buyers**: Shows sustainable harvesting certification and general forest region without exact coordinates
- **For government regulators**: Provides comprehensive compliance data, community consultation records, and environmental impact assessments
- **For consumers**: Displays sustainability claims and responsible forestry practices



## Agricultural Cooperatives

### The Problem
Small farmers producing organic or fair-trade goods need certification of their practices. However, revealing specific farm locations could expose them to:
- Theft of crops and equipment
- Risk from cartels or corrupt officials
- Targeting by commercial competitors
- Security threats in certain regions

### The ProofPack Solution
An agricultural certification app collects complete operational data and creates a full Merkle tree attested on-chain. From this complete dataset, selective disclosure proofs can be created for different stakeholders:

- **For certification bodies**: Reveals detailed farming practices, soil testing results, and processing methods
- **For buyers**: Shows organic certification and fair trade compliance without exact farm locations
- **For government inspectors**: Provides comprehensive compliance data, farmer records, and processing facility details
- **For consumers**: Displays organic certification claims and fair trade practices



## Endangered Species Conservation

### The Problem
Products derived from conservation programs need provenance verification to ensure they come from sustainable sources. However, locations must stay confidential to protect:
- Endangered species from poaching
- Conservation workers from threats
- Breeding programs from interference
- Research facilities from targeting

### The ProofPack Solution
A conservation management app collects complete operational data and creates a full Merkle tree attested on-chain. From this complete dataset, selective disclosure proofs can be created for different stakeholders:

- **For wildlife authorities**: Reveals detailed conservation methods, species monitoring data, and habitat protection measures
- **For buyers**: Shows conservation program participation and sustainable practices without facility locations
- **For government regulators**: Provides comprehensive compliance data, species impact assessments, and facility security measures
- **For consumers**: Displays conservation claims and sustainable harvesting practices



## Stakeholder-Specific Disclosure Patterns

### Buyer-Focused Proofs
Supermarket buyers and retailers typically need proof of certification status and general compliance without detailed operational information. Proofs can reveal:
- Certification status and validity dates
- General region or zone information (not exact coordinates)
- Basic compliance claims and sustainability practices
- Chain of custody verification

### Government Audit Proofs
Regulatory bodies and government inspectors require comprehensive data for compliance verification. Proofs can reveal:
- Detailed operational methods and procedures
- Complete compliance records and audit trails
- Specific location and facility information
- Worker safety and environmental impact data
- Full chain of custody with processing details

### Consumer-Facing Proofs
End consumers need simple, trustworthy claims they can verify. Proofs can reveal:
- Basic sustainability and ethical practice claims
- Certification status and validity
- General provenance information
- Simple verification codes for consumer apps

### Competitor-Protected Proofs
When dealing with competitors or market access requirements, proofs can reveal only the minimum necessary information:
- Basic compliance status
- General certification claims
- Minimal required documentation
- No operational details or competitive advantages

## Benefits for Supply Chain Stakeholders
