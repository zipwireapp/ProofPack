# @zipwire/proofpack

A JavaScript implementation of the ProofPack verifiable data exchange format. ProofPack enables secure, privacy-preserving sharing of structured data with selective disclosure and cryptographic guarantees of authenticity and integrity.

## ðŸš§ Development Status

This JavaScript implementation is currently in **initial setup phase**. The core functionality is not yet implemented. This package serves as the foundational structure for the upcoming JavaScript port of ProofPack.

## Overview

ProofPack is a layered approach to secure, privacy-preserving data exchange with three main layers:

1. **Merkle Exchange Document** - The innermost layer containing the actual data with selective disclosure capabilities
2. **Attested Merkle Exchange Document** - Adds blockchain attestation metadata  
3. **JWS Envelope** - The outermost layer providing cryptographic signatures

## Installation

```bash
npm install @zipwire/proofpack
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- Modern JavaScript environment with ES modules support

## Planned Usage (Not Yet Implemented)

```javascript
import { 
  MerkleExchangeDocument,
  JwsEnvelopeBuilder,
  createMerkleTree 
} from '@zipwire/proofpack';

// Create a Merkle tree with your data
const merkleTree = createMerkleTree({
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 30,
  country: "US"
});

// Create a JWS envelope with the Merkle tree as payload
const builder = new JwsEnvelopeBuilder(signer, {
  type: "JWT",
  contentType: "application/merkle-exchange+json"
});

const jwsEnvelope = await builder.build(merkleTree);
```
